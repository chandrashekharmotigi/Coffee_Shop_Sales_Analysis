# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis - Project Report 📊

## 📝 Project Overview
The objective of this Power BI project was to analyze sales data for a coffee shop and provide actionable insights into sales performance. The focus was on understanding total sales, orders, quantity sold, sales patterns by location and time, and product performance. This analysis aims to help the coffee shop identify key drivers of sales and potential areas for growth.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
The coffee shop needed a deeper understanding of its sales data to make informed business decisions. Key areas of concern included:
- 📈 Monthly total sales, orders, and quantities sold.
- 📅 Sales trends by weekdays, weekends, and store locations.
- 🗓️ Detailed analysis of daily sales and product category performance.
- 🥇 Identification of top products by sales volume.
- ⏰ Hourly sales patterns for optimized staffing and promotions.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Excel**: For initial data cleaning and preparation.
- **Power BI**: For advanced data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Transformation
Data cleaning was conducted in Excel with further transformations in Power BI Power Query to ensure data quality and consistency:
- 🔢 **Data Types**: Corrected numeric columns (e.g., sales amount, quantity sold) for consistency.
- ❌ **Null Values**: Replaced missing numeric values with mean or median values.
- 📅 **Date Standardization**: Ensured a uniform date format across the dataset.
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Applied data validation rules to maintain data accuracy.

## 🗃️ Data Modeling in Power BI
A date table was created to enable time-based analysis and allow filtering. The transaction table was linked to the date table via a common date column.
